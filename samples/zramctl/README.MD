An example from `clean_pickles`. It is `gcc-32-O0-utillinux-zramctl.pkl` from x86.

`zramctl` is the actual binary
`zramctl.debug` is its DIEs
`zramctl-X.json` are each one an entry from the EKLAVYA-formatted dictionary

DEPRECATED: All files are from x86-32, except zramctl.out, which is from x86-64 !!!!
